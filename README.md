# Regression of Boston House Prices using Keras and TensorFlow

In this project, I will create a neural network model with Keras. I will also use scikit-learn to evaluate models using cross-validation. Finally, I will tune the network topology of models with Keras. My backend will be TensorFlow.

### Conclusion
Our baseline model using Keras, TensorFlow, and SciKit-Learn scored: 32.60 (23.52) MSE. However, with standardizing our dataset, tuning our neural network by making our neural network deeper and wider, we were able to score a final 22.29 (29.54) MSE. That's over a $10,000 improvement in mean-squared-error!
